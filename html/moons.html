    <h2>What is a Moon?</h2>
    <p>Planets and asteroids orbit the Sun. Moons—also known as natural satellites—orbit planets and asteroids. Moons
        come in many shapes, sizes and types. Most are airless, but a few have atmospheres and even hidden oceans.
        There are hundreds of moons in our solar system—even a few asteroids have small companion moons.There are
        hundreds of moons in our solar system—even a few asteroids have been found to have small companion moons. The
        table on the right has the most recent count. Moons that begin with a letter and a year are considered
        provisional moons. They will be given a proper name when their discoveries are confirmed by additional
        observations.

                livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable
                climate.</p>

            <p class="planet-text">Like Earth's Moon, Phobos and Deimos always present the same face to their planet.
                They are among the darker objects
                in the solar system. The moons appear to be made of carbon-rich rock mixed with ice and may be captured
                asteroids.</p>

                There are many interesting moons orbiting the planet, but the ones of most scientific interest are the
                Galilean satellites.</p>

            <p class="planet-text">Some moons of Saturn shape its beautiful rings. The
                Voyager and Pioneer flybys provided rough sketches of Saturn’s moons. But NASA’s Cassini spacecraft
                discovered previously unknown moons, solved
                mysteries about known ones</p>
