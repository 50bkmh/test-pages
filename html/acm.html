    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Don’t let the name fool you. Our solar system’s small bodies—asteroids, comets and meteors—pack big surprises.
        Asteroids and comets—and the meteors that sometimes come from them—are leftovers from the formation of our
        solar system 4.6 billion years ago. While the planets and moons have changed over the millennia, many of these
        small chunks of ice, rock and metal have not. They are a lot like a fossil record of planetary evolution.
        At the very beginning of our solar system, before there was an Earth, Jupiter or Pluto, a massive swirling
        cloud of dust and gas circled the young Sun. The dust particles in this disk collided with each other and
        formed into larger bits of rock. This process continued until they reached the size of boulders. Eventually
        this process of accretion formed the planets of our solar system.

        Billions of small space rocks never evolved. Amazingly, many of these mysterious worlds have been altered very
        little in the 4.6 billion years since they first formed. Their relatively pristine state makes the comets,
        asteroids and some meteors wonderful storytellers with much to share about what conditions were like in the
        early solar system. They can reveal secrets about our origins, chronicling the processes and events that led to
        the birth of our world. They might offer clues about where the water and raw materials that made life possible
        on Earth came from.
        There are currently <span class="text-bold">781,692 known asteroids</span> and <span class="text-bold">3,535
            known comets.</span>

            <h2 class="planet-title">Asteroids</h2>
            <p class="planet-text">Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun. Although asteroids orbit the
                Sun like planets, they are much smaller than planets. Most of them live in the main asteroid belt—a
                region
                between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</p>

            <p class="planet-text">Comets orbit the Sun just like planets and asteroids do, except a comet usually has
                a very elongated orbit.The coma is lit by the Sun. The sunlight also pushes this material into the
                beautiful brightly lit tail of the comet.</p>

            <p class="planet-text">Shooting stars are actually bits of debris that fall through our atmosphere.Most
                meteorites found on Earth are larger than a building. Early Earth
                experienced many large meteorite impacts that caused extensive destruction.</p>
