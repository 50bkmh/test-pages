	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>A solar system is a star and all of the objects that travel around it—planets, moons, asteroids, comets
		and meteoroids. Most stars host their own planets, so there are likely tens of billions of other solar
		systems in the Milky Way galaxy alone. Solar systems can also have more than one star. These are called
		binary star systems if there are two stars, or multi-star systems if there are three or more stars.

		The solar system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the vast Milky Way galaxy. It
		consists of the Sun (our star) and everything that orbits around it. This includes the eight planets
		and their natural satellites (such as our moon), dwarf planets and their satellites, as well as
		asteroids, comets and countless particles of smaller debris.

				kilometers, or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth.
				It currently fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million tons of matter

	<h2>Did You Know?</h2>
	<p>Five spacecraft have achieved enough velocity to travel beyond the boundaries of our solar system.
		Voyager 1 crossed into interstellar space in 2012. Voyager 2 and New Horizons are still active and will
		eventually transition to the space between the stars. Pioneers 10 and 11 also have reached escape
		velocity, but both spacecraft have been inactive for many years</p>
