    <h2>What is a Planet?</h2>
    <p>This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer. Everyone knows that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are
        planets. At least, they are for now. Both Pluto and Ceres were once considered planets until new discoveries
        triggered scientific debate about how to best describe themâ€”a vigorous debate that continues to this day. The
        most recent definition of a planet was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. It says a
        planet must do three things: It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun). It must be big enough
        to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape. It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away
        any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun. Discussionâ€”and debateâ€”will continue as
        our view of the cosmos continues to expand</p>

                Moon. Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.</p>
